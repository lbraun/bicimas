## Data manipulations

### Load production data locally
You can download a fresh backup and load it into your local database using the following commands:
```
heroku pg:backups:capture
heroku pg:backups:download
rake db:drop
rake db:create
pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U lucasbraun -d bicimas_development latest.dump
```

You may need to alter privileges on the database to get it to work:
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bicimas_development to rails;
ALTER DATABASE bicimas_development OWNER TO rails;
```


### Dump or load YAML data
The app includes the gem [yaml_db](https://github.com/yamldb/yaml_db) which allows you to use the following commands:
```
rake db:dump
rake db:load
```
